          I joined this project with a couple of patches to improve the experience with my <mark>TS80P</mark>, but definitely have found way much more than just that, such as a lot of wonderful people & very interesting knowledge from them. Gained skills are (but not limited to):
          - getting familiar with <mark>STM</mark>'based MCUs;
          - researching <mark>USB-C</mark> & <mark>QC</mark>/<mark>PD</mark> protocols;
          - <mark>FreeRTOS</mark> fundamentals;
          - <mark>Docker</mark> basics;
          - <mark>GitHub Actions</mark> under the hood;
          - _coding "tidiness"_, implemented & powered by <mark>clang-format</mark> for <mark>C</mark> & <mark>C++</mark> and by linters for <mark>Bash</mark> & <mark>Python</mark>;
          - a lot of _"glue scripting"_ between makefiles, <mark>JSON</mark> configs, <mark>Bash</mark>, <mark>Python</mark> & <mark>C</mark> & <mark>C++</mark> code;
          - minor refactoring of <mark>C</mark> & <mark>C++</mark> code & adding new features;
          - <mark>soft skills</mark>, to find & develop acceptable & compromise solutions for problems with the community together.

        description: |
          I joined this project to improve `Makefile` since I was curious in a couple of aspects of _"tooling"_ the source code tree. But I ended up maintaining, refactoring & improving scripts in <mark>Bash</mark> & <mark>Python</mark>, bringing builds to <mark>GitHub Actions</mark> and getting familiar with <mark>ChibiOS</mark> to add a couple of features to the <mark>firmware</mark>.

          Simple Bash-based wrapper-like scripting app for picocom terminal app.
        description: |
          This is one of my little projects which make life easier. I wrote this <mark>Bash</mark> scripting app since I was getting tired of finding proper full path names for devices in `/dev` and dealing with serial port configuration for every device I have using serial console app manually to access it. Now after installing <mark>picocom</mark>, configuring <mark>udev</mark> & _INI_-like file for the script once, I can get access to all of my pre-configured devices as easy as `$ femtocom  DEVICE_ALIAS` when any of them are just plugged in.

          Researching a multiprotocol USB modem, or Why “S” in IoT still stands for “Security”
        description: |
          Despite unprecedented security incidents with such _IoT botnets_ as _Mirai_, there are still many devices whose security leaves much to be desired. And with a very particular set of skills and some luck, an unsafe device can be turned into an _"attack vector"_ for other devices. Sometimes it is not at all necessary to have hardcore skills in hardware analysis and reverse engineering.  


          The talk was intended for a wide range of specialists interested in <mark>firmware security</mark>. It was overview of the modern device with the hints how to use common software tools for analyzing GNU/Linux‑based firmware for embedded hardware.

          system/vold patch for backward compatibility of Full Disk Encryption in Cyanogenmod 12.1 with 3.x Linux kernel
        description: |
          I had Google Galaxy Nexus back than and since I prefer to use my devices as long as they last, I had to build slightly custom AOSP-based CyanogenMod firmware for my device. But FDE didn't work properly. I had to test, trace & triage the root cause of the issue and fix it.  


          The problem did occur because in system/vold the system call (through device-mapper related crypto API into the kernel space) wasn't compatible with out-of-dated 3.x Linux kernel since user space code in system/vold relied on more updated kernel versions. Therefore, adding backward compatibility in system/vold for 3.x kernel did solve the issue.

          Graphical app to show all the details about a laptop battery in GTK-based GNU/Linux Desktop environments.
        description: |
          This was my very first solo Open Source project which I started from scratch and made it to the first official stable release. This allowed me to get a lot of experience with such things as <mark>Launchpad</mark> infrastructure, <mark>Bazaar</mark> SCM, <mark>apt</mark> repos, <mark>deb</mark> packages, release cycles, <mark>GTK+</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>PyGTK</mark>, <mark>D-Bus</mark> & <mark>UPower</mark>, <mark>UX</mark> & <mark>UI</mark> fundamental concepts.  


          Once the app has been tested & released, the project has been frozen since it's reached its goal and I just didn't have enough of time back then catching up with transitions like GTK2⇒GTK3 & GNOME2⇒GNOME3.
