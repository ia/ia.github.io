          I joined this project with a couple of patches to improve the experience with my <mark>TS80P</mark>, but definitely have found way much more than just that, such as a lot of wonderful people & very interesting knowledge from them. Gained skills are (but not limited to):
          - getting familiar with <mark>STM</mark>'based MCUs;
          - researching <mark>USB-C</mark> & <mark>QC</mark>/<mark>PD</mark> protocols;
          - <mark>FreeRTOS</mark> fundamentals;
          - <mark>Docker</mark> basics;
          - <mark>GitHub Actions</mark> under the hood;
          - _coding "tidiness"_, implemented & powered by <mark>clang-format</mark> for <mark>C</mark>/<mark>C++</mark> and by linters for <mark>Bash</mark> & <mark>Python</mark>;
          - a lot of _"glue scripting"_ between makefiles, <mark>JSON</mark> configs, <mark>Bash</mark>, <mark>Python</mark> & <mark>C</mark>/<mark>C++</mark> code;
          - minor refactoring of <mark>C</mark>/<mark>C++</mark> code & adding new features;
          - <mark>soft skills</mark>, to find & develop acceptable & compromise solutions for problems with the community together.

          I joined this project to improve <mark>Makefile</mark> since I was curious in a couple of aspects of _"toolchaining"_ the source code tree. But I ended up maintaining, refactoring & improving scripts in <mark>Bash</mark> & <mark>Python</mark>, bringing builds to <mark>GitHub Actions</mark> and getting familiar with <mark>ChibiOS</mark> & HydraFW to add a couple of features to the <mark>firmware</mark>.

          This was my very first solo Open Source project which I started from scratch and made it to first stable release. This allowed me to get a lot of experience with such things as <mark>Launchpad</mark> infrastructure, <mark>Bazaar</mark> source control system, apt repos, <mark>deb</mark> packages, release cycles, <mark>GTK+</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>PyGTK</mark>, <mark>DBus</mark> & <mark>UPower</mark>, UX & UI fundamental concepts.  


          Once the app has been tested & released, the project has been frozen since it's reached its goal and I just didn't have enough of time back then catching up with transitions like GTK2/GTK3 & GNOME2/GNOME3.
