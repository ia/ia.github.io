          I joined this project with a couple of patches to improve the experience with my <mark>TS80P</mark>, but definitely have found way much more than just that.

          This was my very first solo Open Source project which I started from scratch and made it to first stable release. This allowed me to get a lot of experience with such things as <mark>Launchpad</mark> infrastructure, <mark>Bazaar</mark> source control system, apt repos, <mark>deb</mark> packages, release cycles, <mark>GTK+</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>PyGTK</mark>, <mark>DBus</mark> & <mark>UPower</mark>, UX & UI fundamental concepts.  


          Once the app has been tested & released, the project has been frozen since it's reached its goal and I just didn't have enough of time back then catching up with transitions like GTK2/GTK3 & GNOME2/GNOME3.
